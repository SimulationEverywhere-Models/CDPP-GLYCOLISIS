------------------------

All the atomic models are working now.

Note:  the internal function [what happens in black box] is written 
in the simplest form possible for now.  This function can be changed 
later on to meet the requested requirements. 

10 atomic models:
step1.h step1.cpp step1.ev step1.ma Running
step2.h step2.cpp step2.ev step2.ma Running
step3.h step3.cpp step3.ev step3.ma Running
step4.h step4.cpp step4.ev step4.ma Running
step5.h step5.cpp step5.ev step5.ma Running
step6.h step6.cpp step6.ev step6.ma Running 
step7.h step7.cpp step7.ev step7.ma Running
step8.h step8.cpp step8.ev step8.ma Running
step9.h step9.cpp step9.ev step9.ma Running
step10.h step10.cpp step10.ev step10.ma Running

Other modified files from cd++:
register.cpp
makefile

Nov 09 2003:

- After make clean in cd++, all the library files (*.a) disappeared.  cd3++ was created, and makefile and *.cpp and *.h files were separated from cd3++, so that make clean can be done everytime without effecting the cd++ files.

Nov 13 2003

- I was not getting the correct output functions.  The internal and output functions were modified to solve these problems.


Nov 15 2003
- All the steps are working.
